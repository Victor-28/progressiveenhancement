    <article id="story">
        <q id="bold">Once upon a time, there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said,<i> <q class="neighbour">“We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate</q></i>.” The farmer said, <i><q class="farmer"><i>Maybe</i></q> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it</q></i>, and in the evening everybody came back and said, “Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!” The farmer again said,<i></q><q class="farmer">“<i>Maybe</i>.” </q></I>
        <I><i>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, <i><q class="neighbour"> Oh dear, that’s too </q> <span class="bad">bad</span>,”</q></i> and the farmer responded,</q></i>  <i><q class="farmer>“<i>Maybe</i>z<i>maybe</>.” </q></i>The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q class="neighbour">“Isn’t that great!” Again, he said, “<i>Maybe</i>”</q></i>
            The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is<span class="good">good</span> good or <span class="bad">bad</span> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.

<i>Conclusion
    <span class="good">Good</span> and <span class="bad">Bad</span> are just one perspective. Bananas are <span class="good">good</span> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <span class="good">good</span> for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</i>
